# Firebase Query Data Access Before Completion

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when accessing query data before the query has finished executing. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  The error typically manifests as an empty or undefined result set or a more general Firebase error.

## Problem
The issue arises when attempting to read data from a Firestore query immediately after initiating it without considering the asynchronous nature of the operation.  This can lead to inconsistent results or application crashes.

## Solution
The solution involves using appropriate asynchronous methods such as promises or async/await to ensure the query is fully completed before accessing the data.  Proper error handling is also crucial to gracefully manage potential network issues or database errors.
