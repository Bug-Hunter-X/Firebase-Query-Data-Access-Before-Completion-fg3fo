The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access data from a query before it's completed. This can happen if you attach a listener or use `get()` on a query that hasn't finished fetching data from the database.  For example:
```javascript
const query = firebase.firestore().collection('users').where('age', '>', 18);
const snapshot = await query.get(); // This line might throw an error if the query hasn't finished
console.log(snapshot.docs); // Accessing data before completion
```
